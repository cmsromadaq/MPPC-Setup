Developer: Pedro F. Toledo

This program is designed to use a setup based on 4 dev
ices:
- 1 Crate VME with 3 Free Slots
- 1 CAEN VME-USM v1718
- 2 CAEN QDC v792

This program communicates through a USB link with  the
v1718 that acquire information from the v792s in order
to generate a TH2F with the histograms of charge measu
red on N detected hits. Is assumed that the signals to
measure as for the gate are correctly stablished for t
he acquisition.

The syntax is:
QDCDataAcquisitionv1.0 <Mask Ch:63-32> <Mask Ch:31-0> 
<Samples> <TH2F Filename>

Example:
QDCDataAcquisitionv1.0 FFFF0000 F0000000 1000 exa.root

This will acquire 1000 samples from channels 28-31 and
48-63, store them on a TH2F with x the channel  number
and save them on exa.root file.

VME Addresses:
It is assumed that the QDC VME Address for the v792 th
at manages the channels 31 to 0 is on 0x00110000 and t
the one managing from 63 to 32 is on 0x00220000.  This
addresses can be changed on lines 46 and 47 on the mai
n file: QDCDataAcquisitionv1.0.cpp

Error Exit Codes:
 0 - No Error
 1 - Error Opening the USB Link
 2 - Problem Writing
 3 - Problem Reading
 4 - Problem BLT Reading
 5 - Invalid Syntax or Input Parameter
 6 - Error on QDC Information Interpretation
 7 - Error Connecting to QDC
